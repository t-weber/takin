	<h1>Convolution Fitting</h1>

		<p>The convolution fitter finds the best least-squares fit of one or several
		free parameters in an S(q,w) model using a Monte-Carlo convolution approach.
		The S(q,w) model is fitted to one or more given measurement data files.</p>

		<p>The fitter is called on the command-line by: "convofit my_fit.job"
		The input job file "my_fit.job" in this example has the following structure:</p>

		<p>Calling "convofit" without command-line arguments shows its global options.</p>
