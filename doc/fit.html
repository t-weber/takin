	<h1>Convolution Fitting</h1>

		<p>The convolution fitter finds the best least-squares fit of one or several
		free parameters in an S(q,w) model using a Monte-Carlo convolution approach.
		The S(q,w) model is fitted to one or more given measurement data files.</p>

		<p>The fitter is called on the command-line by: "convofit my_fit.job"
		The input job file "my_fit.job" in this example has the following structure:</p>

		<code><pre>
		; convofit sample job file

		; input files
		input
		{
		    ; file with the TAS scan
		    scan_file       "my_measurement.dat"

		    ; field column in the scan file
		    field_col        "Bs"

		    ; counter column in the scan file
		    counts_col      "ctr1"

		    ; monitor counter column in the scan file
		    monitor_col     "mon2"

		    ; the Takin resolution parameter dialog

		    ; how is the temperature/field variable named
		    ; the S(q,w) model? Here, "g_T" and "g_H" are
		    ; global variables in the "my_sqw.py" script.
		    sqw_temp_var    "g_T"
		    sqw_field_var   "g_H"

		    ; fix some variables in the S(q,w) model
		    sqw_set_params  "g_my_param = 12.3"
		}

		    plot              1
