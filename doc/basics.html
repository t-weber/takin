	<h1>Basic Usage</h1>

	<p>The main window is divided into two parts: The left-hand side is used for reciprocal-space visualisations:
	The tab "Reciprocal Lattice" shows the Bragg peaks in the current scattering plane and the scattering 
	triangle, the tab "Projection" shows various projective views, e.g. for calculating Laue patterns.

	The right-hand side of the window depicts several real-space visualisations: Here, the real lattice and
	the crystal's unit cell are shown (tab "Real Lattice") as well as the current instrumental position
	for triple-axis spectrometers (tab "TAS Instrument") and for time-of-flight spectrometers
	(tab "TOF Instrument").</p>

	<p>The lattice constants and angles of the crystal's unit cell are entered in the lower-left part of the 
	Takin main window using either the "Real Lattice" or the "Recip. Lattice" tab. The tab "Recip. Plane"
	defines the scattering plane used by the spectrometer.</p>

	<p>If a spacegroup is defined (lower-central part of the main window), the forbidden reflexes are
	excluded in the reciprocal-lattice view. Furthermore, the structure factor and the crystal's unit cell
	are displayed if the atom positions are known: they can be entered using the "Atoms..." button.</p>
